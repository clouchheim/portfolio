            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="about-container">
                <p> Hi, I’m Carter Louchheim, a computer science major at Williams College with a passion for blending technology, linguistics, and the outdoors into meaningful projects. Growing up in the mountains of Utah, I developed a deep love for skiing and the outdoors, competing as an alpine ski racer while learning the value of discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. This connection to the natural world fuels my drive to create tech-driven solutions that intersect with real-world challenges, such as predicting avalanche conditions or analyzing sports performance data.
                Academically and professionally, I specialize in software engineering, data science, and natural language processing (NLP), with a particular interest in low-resource languages. My recent thesis project focuses on building neural machine translation systems to preserve and translate indigenous South American languages. Whether I’m coding a machine learning model, designing an intuitive data visualization tool, or collaborating with stakeholders, I aim to bring curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving to everything I do.
                Outside of my technical work, you’ll find me exploring the mountains, racing down slopes, or seeking new outdoor adventures. I believe the combination of a love for nature and a passion for technology can lead to solutions that are not only innovative but also impactful.

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/clouchheim/Tabular_Data_QA" class="project-link"><strong>Tabular Data Question Answering</strong></a> 
                    - This study investigates the performance of TAPAS, a BERT-based model fine-tuned on a subset of the DataBench dataset, for tabular question-answering (QA). TAPAS significantly outperformed in-context learning (Z-ICL) strategies, achieving up to 48% accuracy on number and category-based questions, though manual answer annotation and dataset limitations constrain broader scalability.</li>
                <li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexanderlawless/album-cover-generation-and-classification-by-genre-65e4a0251d6a" class="project-link"><strong>Album Cover Generation (by Genere)</strong></a> 
                    - This project aims to generate novel album covers conditioned on music genres using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) while exploring whether album cover designs differ significantly across genres. Additionally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was built to test the feasibility of predicting album genres based solely on their cover art, achieving ~56% accuracy on a small dataset.</li>
                <li><a href="https://carter-louchheim.shinyapps.io/BiomechanicsDashboard/?_gl=1*197f3j5*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTEwNTMxNDc0Ni4xNzM0NDAxNTc5*_ga_HXP006LBGY*MTczNDQwMTU3OC4xLjAuMTczNDQwMTU3OC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTczNDQwMTU3OC4xLjAuMTczNDQwMTU3OC4wLjAuMA.." class="project-link"><strong>Nordic Skiing Biomechanics Dashboard</strong></a> 
                    - This project is a biomechanics visualization dashboard developed for the US Ski Team, designed to analyze and compare athlete movement data. The framework allows for 3D visualizations of specific body parts and views for the chosen stride, and it enables comparisons of the same view between two athletes. Additionally, the dashboard is capable of providing summary statistics—such as range of motion and stride length—and facilitates comparisons when multiple athletes are selected. However, due to data privacy restrictions, the dashboard currently lacks actual data due to privacy policies.</li>
                <li><a href="https://carter-louchheim.shinyapps.io/FinalTurnAnalysis/?_gl=1*9ebce8*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTEwNTMxNDc0Ni4xNzM0NDAxNTc5*_ga_HXP006LBGY*MTczNDQwMTU3OC4xLjAuMTczNDQwMTU3OC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTczNDQwMTU3OC4xLjAuMTczNDQwMTU3OC4wLjAuMA.." class="project-link"><strong>Alpine Skiing GPS Dashboard</strong></a> 
                    - This project aims to visualize and compare GPS data from athletes during alpine training, providing detailed insights into their performance on the slopes. The framework includes 3D visualizations of runs, granular analysis of terrain, and metrics such as time lost or gained per turn, as well as speed throughout the course. All of these metrics are calculated from the GPS data collected during the runs. However, due to data privacy restrictions, the project currently lacks public athlete data and serves as a framework for future use, pending access to the necessary GPS data.</li>
                <li><a href="pdfs/Gentrification.pdf" class="project-link"><strong>Gentrification and Education in Seattle</strong></a> 
                    - This research examines the relationship between gentrification and high school test scores in Seattle, Washington, using a novel metric to identify 14 gentrified census tracts across the city's school districts. By analyzing American Community Survey data from 2010-2019, the study reveals a widespread decline in test scores for economically disadvantaged students, though no direct correlation was found between this decline and gentrification, leaving open critical questions about the factors influencing academic performance.</li>
